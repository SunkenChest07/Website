							<h4>Cybersecurity Plan</h4>
								<p>I have an Obsidian(Notetaking App) vault that I have been working on that has detailed lists of software and hardware that you can use as well as habits you can utilise in
								your everyday life to protect yourself mainly digitally but in the end may also protect you physically. <br> This of course is a work in progress and might take me a little over a couple of moths
								to finish "everything", I put quotes on that becuase I highly doubt that there's a definite end to complete security and privacy for everyone. But I feel having a crackshot plan for myself and 
								then sharing that plan with other people around me is the best way to reach that.</p>
							<h4>DIY Wimshurst Machine</h4>
								<p>Started planning this around mid way through 2024 but hit a hard spot once external assesments set in and the time I had to draw up technical plans for it lessened I eventually put the plans in a box.
								<br> The only other thing that was stopping me was a set of callipers so that I could measure the dimensions of a couple of skateboard bearings I was planning to use.</p>
							<h4>Oh the things you can do with Raspberry Pi</h4>
								<p>While I didn't have any specific plans for just one Pi the wonder that is the internet has hundreds of maker projects which include Pi type devices in them,
								from Media Centers to NAS's, to a personal DNS and Web servers. These little things can do a lot, which gives these little things a lot larger a use case than just a "small computer".</p>
