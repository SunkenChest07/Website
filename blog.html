							<h4>I don't really know?</h4>
								<p>I've only ever done a blog in year 11 English class where we had to make a territory relevant blog. Pretty sure I did it on a blogging site "Blogger" and it was about the street art around Katherine. Got a pretty good grade for that.
								</p>
								<p>But there should be a secure way for me to host a blog or at least document some things. Like I really like Beekeeping, got seriously invested in it around 2 terms into year 12. Just didnt really have the space for some kind of apiary.
									As well as the fact that the chane of bee's migrating into the yard isn't very likely. Not because of lack of foliage, there's plenty of flowers and such, just the animals in our's and the neighbors house's. Making it more of a problem than a sustained hive.
