						<p>I am an aspiring IT Guy if thats the right way to describe what I'm currently interested in/doing.
							With interest's based in technology since I was a youngin' in the 2010's growing up without the "latest tech" of the time
							and the things I grew up around being more analogue; CRT's, Late 2000s VHS tapes and a whole lot of DVD's. All the way up until around year 3-5 in primary school where
							Ipads and Dell Desktops were the main way they taught us the simpler things. Like Garage band and Rainforest Maths, other than free time where we found blocked websites and trying to get to our beloved violent gun games.
							but aside from that. Most of my more technical skill came on as a result of researching the heck out of the way headphones work so I could choose which headphones would be the best bang for my buck in high school. </p>
						<p>Nowadays I have more of a focus on Information Technology and I say that as the broadest term that I can use for this field
							with those mostly being invested into; Audio and audio technology with slight glimpses into the Audiophile world, 
							Got invested into Amatuer Radio and got a good foundation test score just dont have an assesor, I have now started looking into some light 
							HTML and CSS to make my own website as well as some networking and terminal work to host it. Then hopefully sometime in the near future
							Where I'm in cybersecurity or engineering working to afford my next Elecraft radio. </p>
