						<p>Is supposed to be a display of my programming and web hosting abilities in a nutshell. Hopefully I'll be able to finish
							it up and have the website doing a couple of other things than just being a mini biography. In the near future I want to 
							use it as my main social platform using it as a sort of portal site to take poeple to other places where I'll be. <br><br>
							This page is currently a bit lacklustre but the Things tab has a bit of what Is use and the About section has, a little bit about me.</p>
